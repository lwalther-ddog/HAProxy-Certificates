# HAProxy-Certificates

This project brings all you need to know to effortlessly &amp; successfully configure an HTTPs proxy.


It is soooo simple to set an HAProxy, isn't it? If that's the case, don't worry about this repo. Otherwise, if you spent some hours from your life trying to make things fit their places, keep on reading. You will know everything about these .PEM certifiates.

This setup was based on the sample code for https on front and backends of your proxy  as available on datadog link - https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/proxy/?tab=linux#haproxy

You are going to need two certificates to make the thing work. One for your proxy server, and the other to connect to datadog website. There's no need to pay for the certificates... Just follow the right procedure and you will be able to set and make everything work.

Hope this could be useful for someone who was almost giving up !

See ya !
